# Data Analysis and Prediction App 📊🤖

This **Streamlit** app allows users to upload a dataset, select a numerical target variable, visualize the data, and train a regression model to predict the target value. It uses **scikit-learn** for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.

## Features 🌟

- **Upload a Dataset**: Users can upload a CSV file for analysis. 📂
- **Select Target Variable**: Choose a numerical target variable from the dataset. 🎯
- **Visualize the Data**: Create bar charts for categorical data and analyze correlations with the target variable. 📊
- **Train a Regression Model**: Train a model to predict the target value based on selected features. 🔍
- **Make Predictions**: Input new data and use the trained model to predict the target variable. 🔮
